# skillbridge
SkillBridge is a platform that connects companies with skilled individuals through project-based assessments. Companies can post real-world projects, and users can complete them to showcase their abilities. Instead of relying solely on resumes, companies get a direct evaluation of candidates' skills based on their performance.
